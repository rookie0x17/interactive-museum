The hologram pyramid is a simple device that can be made by manipulating a sheet of plastic into the shape of a pyramid with its top cut off. The device creates a 3D-like illusion for the viewer and makes an image or video appear as if it were in midair. It works on the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost" target="_blank">Pepper's Ghost</a>. Four symmetrically opposite variations of the same image are projected onto the four faces of the&nbsp;pyramid. By principle, each side projects the image falling on it to the center of the pyramid. These projections work in unison to form a whole figure, which creates a 3D illusion.

<p>Now this is very easy instructable to turn your smartphone into a small hologram. It takes roughly 10-15 minutes to make it.</p>
<p>First of all you will need these materials to proceed:</p>
	<ul><li>Acrylic plexiglass.</li><li>Graph or Plain Paper.</li><li>Pen.</li><li>Tape.</li><li>Scissor.</li><li>Cutter.</li><li>Smartphone.</li></ul></div>
	


1. Print out the template shown below on a sheet of A4-size paper.

<div class="container"><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you do not have access to a printer, you can also make a template on your own. Draw a basic "Trapezoid" on a piece of paper using these dimensions. Parallel sides= 1cm, 6cm &amp; other two sides= 4.5cm each. You can always double or triple the dimensions in proportion to use on a larger display.
<br><br>2. Trace out the shape on the plastic sheet using a ruler and pen. For the trapezoid template, trace out four similar outlines on the plastic sheet. Now carefully&nbsp;cut out the outlines with a cutting blade and ruler. Try to make your cuts as precise as possible for a perfect pyramid.
<br><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>3. </span><strong>If you used the printout template:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Score the red edges very lightly using a cutting blade. This will allow you to fold the edges better and form a pyramid shape.&nbsp;Stick the open edges of the sheet together using clear cellotape.
<br></span><strong><br>If you used the trapezoid template:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Join the four edges to form a pyramid shape.&nbsp;Stick them together.
<br><br>Either way, in the end you will have a pyramid like the one shown below.</span><br></p></div></div></div>

<div class="container"><div class="columns"><div class="column is-8 is-offset-2"><p>4. That's it! You have made yourself a hologram pyramid! All you have to do now is go into the holograms section and enjoy your interactive experience in your phone.&nbsp;Place the hologram pyramid in the middle&nbsp;of your screen, like shown in the image below, and enjoy the show. Don't forget to switch off the lights in the room before you start playing the video.</p></div></div></div>
